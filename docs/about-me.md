# Work History

---
### Head of Computer Networks and Cybersecurity   (2020-08 - 2022-06)
#### Sharjah Economic Development Department - UAE 

- Worked as team leader and head of network and
cybersecurity unit by working with seven engineers
ranging from mid to expert levels. Discussing and
planning best practices in regards to automating
various on-premise and cloud resources based on
software engineering KPIs including: team
collaboration, automation, culture, measurement,
and sharing.
- Researching Ansible best practices including sharing
  Ansible content using GitHub version control,
  decoupling inventories from projects, decoupling
  roles and collections, writing simply reusable and
  declarative playbooks, develop Ansible playbooks
  using coding best practices, tagging playbooks,
  integrating with CI/CD tools such as GitHub and
  Jenkins, and benchmark evidence.
- Adopted Vagrant as development environment to
  test Ansible playbooks before deploying them into
  production environment. This helped to reduce
  errors and avoid human configuration errors by
  100%.
- Designed Ansible playbooks to spin up new instances of MongoDB database, identifying primary
  of each replica set, joining new instances to each
  replica set, orchestrating elections among all replica
  sets, and removing all replica sets. This allowed us to
  upgrade MongoDB without taking database down
  or degrading performance.

### Senior Systems and Network Engineer (2018-03 - 2020-08)
#### Sharjah Economic Development Department - UAE

- Planning and automating AWS EC2 deployment
using Ansible by writing playbooks to provision VPC,
internet gateway, subnet, routing table, and security
group. This resulted in more efficient scalability of
systems for each application which achieved 300%
faster kicking off of EC2 instances than manual
configuration.
- Automating NetApp Ontap, SolidFire, HPE3Par, IBM
  Sorewise storage administration tasks including
  creating, editing, and deleting volumes. This is
  accomplished by using certified RedHat Ansible
  certified modules which have various options to
  manage actions including defining volume name,
  aggregate, size, export policy, and security features.
- Protecting Ansible projects sensitive data
  (passwords, and private keys) by encrypting values
  and data structure of playbooks using Ansible Vault.
  This helps to keep all of configuration data in one
  place without compromising security.
- Securing credentials by Ansible towers/AWX. This
  grants users and teams ability to use these
  credentials, without actually exposing credential to
  users.
- Writing task-oriented Ansible playbooks to automate
  secure application deployment on multiple BIG-IP
  devices across data centers. This includes creating
  application pool, adding members to pool, and
  creating virtual load balancer.
- Automating log collection to SIEM of NGFWs
  including Checkpoint, Cisco Firepower, Fortinet, and
  PaloAlto using Ansible. This has accelerated
  investigation and response to threats across enterprise in coordinated, unified way using curated
  collection of modules, roles and playbooks.

### Network and Security Engineer 
#### Sharjah Economic Development Department - UAE

- Automating Windows administration tasks by
integrating Ansible to use Window Remote
Management (WinRM). This supports: gather facts
about Windows, install and uninstall MSI packages,
enable and disable windows features, start and stop
services, manage windows updates, push and
execute windows powershell scripts.
- Creating Linux users, raw disks, and volumes by using
Ansible shell, raw, command, and script modules
and configuring handlers to apply changes on
services based on notify action.
- Automating installation of Apache web servers by
using Ansible package module. Configuring web
content using Ansible copy module and managing
service using service module.
- Writing Python scripts and Ansible config files to
dynamically inventory of resources in AWS. This helps
to have more visibility and more flexibility in
gathering information about resources that are
frequently changing and as result reduced
administration time by 200%.
